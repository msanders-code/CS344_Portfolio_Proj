How to compile the code:

	1. Make sure that all the files are in the directory:
		- 'builtInCmds.c'
		- 'commandParser.c'
		- 'main.c'
		- 'redirectIO.c'
		- 'runCmd.c'
		- 'builtin.h'
		- 'cmd.h'
		- 'commandstruct.h'
		- 'Makefile'

	2. From the commandline, run the command 'make':

		$ make

	
	This will create an executable file called 'smallsh'.
